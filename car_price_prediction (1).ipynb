        "I chose a scatter plot because it's a commonly used chart type for visualizing the relationship between two continuous variables, such as horsepower and price in this case. Scatter plots are effective for identifying patterns, trends, and correlations in the data. By plotting price against horsepower, we can visually inspect if there's any discernible relationship between these two variables, such as whether cars with higher horsepower tend to have higher prices. If there's a relationship, it might be useful for understanding the pricing dynamics in the automotive market. Additionally, scatter plots are straightforward to interpret and communicate the data effectively to others."

        "\n",
        "Mean Imputation: I used mean imputation because it is a straightforward method and is often a reasonable approach when the missing values are assumed to be missing at random (MAR). Mean imputation preserves the overall distribution of the data and minimizes the impact on the mean of the variable.\n",
        "Applicability to Numerical Data: Mean imputation is applicable to numerical data types, making it suitable for handling missing values in columns containing continuous or interval data, such as 'normalizedlosses'.\n",
        "Robustness: Mean imputation is robust to outliers since it calculates the mean based on all available data points in the column. Outliers do not disproportionately influence the imputed values.\n",
        "While mean imputation is a simple and commonly used technique, it's important to note that it has limitations and assumptions. For example, it assumes that the missing values are missing completely at random (MCAR) or missing at random (MAR), and it may lead to biased estimates if the missingness mechanism is not met. Additionally, mean imputation may not be appropriate for categorical variables or when the missingness is related to the value itself (e.g., higher-income individuals are less likely to disclose their income).\n",
        "\n",
        "Other imputation techniques, such as median imputation, mode imputation, k-nearest neighbors (KNN) imputation, or predictive modeling, may be more appropriate depending on the characteristics of the data and the nature of missingness. It's important to carefully consider the assumptions and limitations of each technique and choose the most suitable approach based on the specific dataset and analytical goals."

Dimensionality reduction techniques such as PCA (Principal Component Analysis) or t-SNE (t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding) can be used to project high-dimensional data into lower-dimensional space while preserving the structure and relationships among data points, making visualization easier.\n",

By retaining the principal components that explain most of the variance, PCA effectively reduces the dimensionality of the dataset while preserving as much information as possible.\n",
        "Efficiency and Effectiveness: PCA is computationally efficient and widely used for dimensionality reduction tasks. It is particularly effective when the data exhibits linear correlations between features and when the variance is an essential criterion for capturing the underlying structure of the data.\n",
        "Interpretability: PCA produces orthogonal components, making them interpretable and facilitating the understanding of the underlying structure of the data. Each principal component represents a combination of the original features, allowing for insights into the most significant patterns in the data.\n",
        "Versatility: PCA is a versatile technique that can be applied to various types of data, including numerical data, image data, and high-dimensional datasets. It can be used for exploratory data analysis, feature extraction, and visualization tasks.\n",
        "Overall, PCA was chosen as the dimensionality reduction technique because of its ability to preserve variance, efficiency, interpretability, and versatility. It is a widely used and effective method for reducing the dimensionality of datasets while retaining most of the essential information."

        "Balance Between Training and Testing Data: The 80-20 split strikes a balance between having enough data for model training and having enough data for model evaluation. By allocating 80% of the data for training, we ensure that the model has sufficient samples to learn the underlying patterns in the data. At the same time, reserving 20% of the data for testing allows us to evaluate the model's performance on unseen data.\n",
        "Commonly Used Splitting Ratio: The 80-20 split is a commonly used splitting ratio in machine learning. It has been empirically found to work well across a wide range of datasets and modeling tasks. Using a well-established splitting ratio can help ensure consistency and comparability with other studies and experiments.\n",
        "Reduced Risk of Overfitting: With a larger proportion of the data allocated to training, the model has more samples to learn from, which can help reduce the risk of overfitting. Overfitting occurs when the model learns to memorize the training data rather than generalize to unseen data. By having a substantial amount of testing data, we can assess the model's ability to generalize beyond the training set.\n",
        "Adequate Evaluation: Reserving 20% of the data for testing provides an adequate amount of data for evaluating the model's performance. This allows for more reliable estimates of the model's accuracy, precision, recall, and other performance metrics.\n",
        "Overall, the 80-20 data splitting ratio strikes a balance between training and testing data, reduces the risk of overfitting, and provides adequate data for model evaluation, making it a suitable choice for many machine learning tasks."
